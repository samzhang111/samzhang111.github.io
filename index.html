I will be starting a PhD in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/amath/">Department of Applied Mathematics</a> at the University of Colorado, Boulder in Fall 2019.
<p>

My interest is at the intersection of data science with networks, graphs, dynamics, and topology. Some themes for me are:
<ul>
    <li> 1) expanding the mathematical tools used in data science, and</li>
    <li> 2) applying data science toward socially impactful problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>

I received B.A.'s in Computer Science and Psychology from Swarthmore College in 2014. I was also a 2014 <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a>.

<p>

Prior to becoming a math person, I worked at <a href="https://opencounter.com/">OpenCounter</a> and <a href="https://pivotal.io/labs">Pivotal Labs</a>.
