    Look at how calm this website has become.
    <p>
    How quiet. How peaceful.

    Snow has fallen, and nothing disturbs it yet.

    You can choose your emotional adventure today! Today I feel like...
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/text/commencement.txt">reading Sam's commencement speech on behalf of the 2024 graduating CU Boulder Applied Math PhD students</a></li>
        <li><a href="/nora">being confronted with the enormity of someone else's grief</a></li>
        <li><a href="/images/far-side-maybe-we-should-write-that-spot-down.jpg">learning about life</a> from <a href="/images/far-side-mind-over-matter.jpg">Far Side comics</a></li>
    </ul>

        Or instead, of course, you can visit <a href="/main">Sam's main academic presence</a>.
