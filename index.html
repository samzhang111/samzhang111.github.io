    Look at how calm this website has become.
    <p>
    How quiet. How peaceful.

    Snow has fallen, and nothing disturbs it yet.

    You can choose your emotional adventure today! Today I feel like...
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/text/commencement.txt">reading Sam's commencement speech on behalf of the 2024 graduating CU Boulder Applied Math PhD students</a></li>
        <li><a href="/nora">being confronted with the enormity of someone else's grief</a></li>
        <li><a href="/images/far-side-maybe-we-should-write-that-spot-down.jpg">learning the most important lesson about statistics, machine learning, and causal inference (and in fact, all of life) from a single Far Side comic</a> (which is to say, I wrote the spot of this comic down)</li>
        <li><a href="/images/far-side-mind-over-matter.jpg">learning the second most important lesson about all of life from a Far Side comic</a></li>
        <li><a href="/html/unfolding/index.html">unfolding a 4-dimension polytope</a></li>
        <li><a href="{% post_url 2018-12-26-ascii-plotting %}">plotting equations using ASCII art</a></li>
        <li><a href="{% post_url 2019-06-21-least-squares-springs %}">learning how linear regression can be done with springs</a></li>
        <li><a href="{% post_url 2018-12-18-cats-on-ladders %}">predicting what path a cat would trace through the air if it were sitting on a ladder that slid away from a wall</a></li>
        <li>leaving this website, preparing to listen to some music, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFrqclcm8pU">coming on up to the house</a></li>
    </ul>

        Or instead, of course, you can visit <a href="/main">Sam's main academic presence</a>.
