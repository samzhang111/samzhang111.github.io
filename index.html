<p>
I am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. My advisor is <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/">Aaron Clauset</a>.

<p>
My research is at the intersection of social science, data science, and applied mathematics. I'm particularly interested in understanding the forces that shape the scientific ecosystem, as well as broadly, applications of data science toward the social good. I also just like math, particularly the type that isn't usually viewed as "applied"!
<p>

I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Psychology from Swarthmore College in 2014. I was a 2014 <a href="https://dssgfellowship.org/">University of Chicago Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a>. Then I worked as a software engineer at companies such as <a href="https://opencounter.com/">OpenCounter</a> and <a href="https://pivotal.io/labs">Pivotal Labs</a>.
