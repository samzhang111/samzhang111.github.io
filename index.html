I will be starting a PhD in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/amath/">Department of Applied Mathematics</a> at the University of Colorado, Boulder in Fall 2019.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for four years as a software engineer at companies such as <a href="https://opencounter.com/">OpenCounter</a> and <a href="https://pivotal.io/labs">Pivotal Labs</a>.

I received B.A.'s in Computer Science and Psychology from Swarthmore College in 2014. I was also a 2014 <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a>.
