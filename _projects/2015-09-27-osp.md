I've been volunteering for the [Open Syllabus
Project](http://opensyllabusproject.org) on and off since the Spring of
2013. I attended a hackathon called GLAMhacks (Galleries, Libraries,
Archives, and Museums) at the University of Pennsylvania with my
friend Rita Zevallos. We decided to rescuscitate this corpus of [1M
syllabi](http://www.dancohen.org/2011/03/30/a-million-syllabi/), which
was missing a majority of the cached syllabus content (only having URLs
and other metadata). Over the next two days we poached the Starbucks
wifi across the street to download as many of the syllabi as we could
from the Wayback Machine.

Rita built a rails app on top of the corpus, and we planned to
call it... (drumroll)... Sylla-search. It was a stupid name, so
we thought harder, and considered calling it "The Open Syllabus
Project". The name proved fortuitous, because we discovered that
a team out of Columbia University had been working on the exact
same project. Their progress was a direct superset of ours. They
had already taken Dan Cohen's 1M syllabi, and combined it with a
variety of dumps, gifts, and scrapes, with the purpose of providing
researchers metadata access to what the global syllabi-scape looked
like. I joined them as a volunteer.  In the time since then, they've
hired a [fantastic programmer](http://github.com/davidmcclure)
to create a variety of [analytics, visualizations, and other
interfaces](https://github.com/overview/osp) to the underlying data.

Some of the things that I've done with them in the intervening time:

* A machine learning classifier for whether a document is a syllabus or not: [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/samzhang111/syllabus-classifier/blob/master/Syllabus%20Classifier.ipynb) [code](https://github.com/samzhang111/syllabus-classifier)
