I've just published a [six-part series](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/04/03/waning-storm-stormfront-posters-segregated-along-topics-related-race-anti-semitism) with the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org) on Stormfront, a far-right extremist forums. The analysis consisted of scraping the forums, linking the conversation structure of posts within threads, and looking at correlations between the results of a topic model, place mentions, and so forth. Much of the code [can be found here](https://github.com/samzhang111/stormfront-analyses).

I've been collaborating with a team at [Data for Democracy](datafordemocracy.org) on pursuing this further.
