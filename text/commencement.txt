Let me start by telling you all a story about my family, who are in the audience. My dad's a researcher, my mom's a poet, and my sister's a teacher. They got really into mushroom foraging during COVID in 2020, and they came up with this saying that I'd like to share with you:

Doing research is like foraging for mushrooms. You can't go looking for a mushroom and expect to find it there. The best you can do is to arm yourself with knowledge so that you can recognize one when you see it and then, go for walks with people you like in the places you like walking.

I've had the pleasure of "mushroom foraging" with some of the best scientists and mathematicians in the last few years. I'd like to particularly thank Aaron Clauset and Dan Larremore. You've taught me what it means to be a researcher, and walking in the woods wouldn't be the same without you.

So with that, I'd like to dedicate the remainder of my time to those who have made our mathematical journeys possible, and who, unlike us, are no longer walking step by step towards infinity, but who have moved into the limit. So let's take a brief moment of silence for Keith Julien, for my partner Nora, our greyhound Tulia, and for anyone else we've lost along the way.

(silence)

Thank you Keith, thank you Nora, thank you Tulia, and thank you all.
