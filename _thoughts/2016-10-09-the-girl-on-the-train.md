Oh my God. This movie exploits the trope that women are hysterical for its only plot device. I can understand how the twist in the plot is subversive. The film sets you up to believe that Rachel is unreliable as a narrator, and each of the female characters play into stereotypes of women-as-hysteric*, but it explains in the end, that their states of mind were undergirded by this psychotic, murderous, abusive man hidden in plain sight. But the fact that Rachel was vindicated as the murderer doesn't matter -- her unreliability still made the entire story possible.

The movie presents a Rashomon scenario with the twist that the different accounts are all arising out of Rachel's attempts to remember her _own_ story. She was led to believe, along with the audience, that she had killed Megan. Thus she is a fragile character not just in the world of the movie, but also in the space between the movie and reality -- she was setup as a character to be vulnerable to shifts in her reality. The movie goes full hog on this idea, and plays it as if Rachel
remembers being physically abusive against her ex-husband, only to later remember that she herself was abused.

Does this type of reversal, where abused people misremember themselves as abusers, have any psychological basis? I feel like this is an important question to determine whether the movie was portraying a chilling aftermath of abuse, or if it just reimagined hysteria and assigned it to the female characters for plot. I'm going with the latter.

The camera maintained this strange, steely, exterior gaze the whole time. It deemed Rachel to be irrational and alcoholic, incapable of processing her feelings, and stalky ever since her divorce. By comparison, I thought [Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_(2015_film\)) was much more thoughtful in how it allied the camera with the inner world of abuse. 

The movie takes Rachel's trauma for granted. How did she start her descent into alcoholism, or losing her memory? We know it had to do with being abused at the hands of her husband, but that's it. Despite all the time the characters spend on the psychiatrist's couch, it never gives Rachel the chance to understand her own abuse! She is never portrayed as sane or rational. The insinuation that being abused makes one more unreliable is never challenged. Rachel's her confusion drives the entire plot forward, yet the movie never stops to help her understand herself. In other words, the movie exploited her unreliability as a plot device. Imagine Fight Club, except hysteria is used to explain why the main character had a psychotic break. Yeah, pretty fucked up.


\* Let's count the ways:

1) Rachel is a crazy, alcoholic ex-wife. Obviously women lose their minds after breakups.

2) Megan has this histrionic, sexual thing going on where she won't stop seducing her therapist, plus the camera lavishes this gratuitous attention on her self-psychoanalyzing

3) Anna's desire to take care of her kid is portrayed as this twisted yuppie thing. The audience has a laugh at her expense for insisting on hand-pureeing yams for her son. I mean, it is kind of a rich, spoiled moment, but why does she even need that character trait?
