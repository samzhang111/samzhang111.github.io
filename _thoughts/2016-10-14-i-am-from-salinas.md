I've been starting a new job in California the last two weeks, and around all of the travel and working that I'm doing, the thought of "music" just sort of slipped my mind. I didn't bring a guitar and this room doesn't have one, and I was distracted enough that I went a few days without it. Music from stores doesn't count -- that music makes you feel dehydrated and itchy -- I'm talking about music that nourishes you. It's an interesting how not listening to music for a few days
introduces a distinct kind of dryness. I listened to a few songs before sleeping on my cell phone, but the tinniness of the sound didn't help that sense of being dried.

I rediscovered music when I rented a car. It had a stereo! With Bluetooth input! My phone connected to it, and I listened to Laura Marling's _Once I Was an Eagle_. It was revelatory, and I drank it up, over and over again. Even though Laura Marling is English, her music spread out and filled space in my car in California much better than any previous attempts I've had at listening to her. So I thought it was very fitting when I branched out and listened to _A Creature I Don't Know_ as well, and heard a song called [_Salinas_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmLCm-0TgSI).

```
I am from Salinas where the women go forever
And they never ever stop to ask why
My mother was a savior of six foot of bad behavior
Long blonde curly hair down to her thigh
```

But around half a week in, I was having trouble falling asleep. For me, unless I have certain atmospheric aspects of the place I'm sleeping under my control, it can get difficult to fall
asleep. A hotel for a night is fine, and even a week is ok, it's just the premise of _living_ somewhere, like a dorm, or an extended-stay Airbnb at my new job, that I get antsy at night. That sense of parchedness pervaded the architecture, and my sleep. The fact that the Airbnb is so richly furnished with exactly items that I have absolutely no use for exascerbates this feeling: two stiff, floral sofas, a TV that I don't watch, a single print of a nature painting, a wooden family dining table that seats 6 with fake yellow flowers. The sense is one of wrong-headed abundance. Of being in the richest county in the country, yet in drought; of getting a new job, and not listening to music.

To lull myself to sleep, I started placing my laptop near me and listening to a song or two before placing it on the floor and sleeping. This grew to the point where I slept with the laptop on the bed, falling asleep by [Little Love Caster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGSw5u7Qndk) and it played through half of Laura Marling's ouvre before I woke up. I really liked the songs I woke up to, which is how I started listening to _A Creature I Don't Know_.

Two nights ago, I tossed and turned all night. It was one of those nights where when I got up to use the bathroom, I went abruptly, as if I wanted to burn out the last of my hastiness. It's kind of hilarious in retrospect, bolting out of bed and rigidly walking to the bathroom, but I think it reflects a kind of perfectionism borne out of work. At work, I'm someone who prides myself for being a fast coder and having honed my habits into reflexes. Taken too far, what could I be more practiced at than peeing at night?

Lately I've been having trouble with rambling too much in stories, and finding myself almost lost or something, far from where I started. I'm very happy that I've managed to surround myself with people who forgive me enough to stay with me anyway.
