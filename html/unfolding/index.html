            <h3>Ridge unfoldings of a 3d cube!</h3>
            <div>Here we see the shadows of a cube as we perform a "ridge unfolding". The graph to the left controls the unfolding, and on the right, we see the "stamp" left behind by the cube as it unfolds. Notice that each face of a 3d cube is a "2d cube" (or square). <b>Todo: implement an actual 3d cube unfolding</b></div>

        <div class="container" id="3d">
            <h3>Ridge unfoldings of a 4d cube</h3>
            <div>Here we see the shadows of a 4-dimensional cube during a ridge unfolding. This is exactly like the case above, except now the faces of the 4d cube are 3d cubes, so the unfolded structure consists of connected cubes.</div>
