<h1>
    Why write about bugs?
</h1>

<p>
Knowledge begins to appear obvious once it is acquired. Without deliberate
effort, the learning process is obscured.

<p>
Expertise and professionalism are performative,
and they often demand us to come off as smarter than we really are. That too
obscures the learning process.

<p>
I believe that these obfuscations lead to the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6219/262"> expectations of brilliance</a> that make fields less welcoming.

<p>
To fight against this, I will try to write about bugs. Especially,
I want to document times I struggle to discover an answer that feels
obvious in retrospect.  Those are the pieces of experience for which I
am most likely to act as if I didn't have to struggle to acquire it.
