    Why <a href="http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/News/howtomakeinsectcollection_647/">bugs</a>?
</h1>

<p>
There's a type of binary thinking I'm trying to fight by blogging about my
bugs, which is the subversive way that knowledge begins to appear inevitable
once it is acquired.

<p>
A corollary to this is that expertise and professionalism are performative,
and they often demand us to come off as snappier and smarter than we really are. It
obscures the process through which we come to our solutions. I believe that these
obfuscations lead to the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6219/262">
expectations of brilliance</a> that make certain academic fields less welcoming than others.

<p>
But what is a bug, even? As soon as I start trying to document all of the
bugs I fix, I realize that there is not a hard line separating a normal
everyday confusion and a "bug". The other day, I had a deeply mysterious
moment where I couldn't find my phone right after using it. It felt like a
magic trick. I just woke up, and checked my phone, and after standing up,
it was gone. Is that a bug? I used similar problem-solving approaches,
such as muttering curse words and turning everything over. (Eventually I
called it to find it, and it turned out I had used it as a bookmark). In
a similarly mystical way, the code we write stops working when we least
expect it, and in baffled tones we comb over the spots we think it
could be.

<p>
A colleague at Pivotal Labs showed me a way of thinking that has
simplified my concept of bugs. He recommended calling all bugs
"regressions" instead, to make clear that it refers only to something
that has once worked, but "regressed" to a state of not working as it
once did. This is in contrast to how people often think of a bug as any
glitchy behavior in general, even if it was never promised to not be
glitchy. Making something look and behave nicely for the first time is
a feature, though, not a bug.

<p>
I take a much looser definition for this blog. Any struggle with understanding
how a given technology works, or any unexpected behavior, is grounds for a post.
I want to write about the process of coming to an answer, and show off the
reality of how I come to them.
