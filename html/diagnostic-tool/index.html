            <ul>
                <li>The square on the line is the number of tenure-track faculty from that given scrape.</li>
                <li>The diamond above the line is the total number of people (not just tenure-track) parsed from that scrape. If you can't see a diamond, then they are smushed together.</li>
                <li>The dashed black line is the number of people in the 2011 Census.</li>
            </ul>

            For each scrape, we calculate how far it is from the 2011 scrape (we divide the scrape count by the census count, and say a scrape is "suspicious" if that proportion is greater than 2 or less than 0.5). We divide the number of suspicious scrapes by the total number of scrapes: that is the ratio displayed next to each university name.
