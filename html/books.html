<h1>
    books I've finished lately
</h1>

<div>I am one of those people who always has a half-dozen or more books
in flight at any given time, so I have decided to start writing down
titles as I finish them. Finishing books is a pleasure I find myself
consistently underrating, so I hope keeping this list will encourage me to
finish more of them.
<p> 
The parenthetical date is the date I finished a book.
