    <p>

    I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://santafe.edu" target="_blank">Santa Fe Institute</a>, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.santafe.edu/~moore/" target="_blank">Cris Moore</a>. In Fall 2025, I will be joining the <a href="https://vermontcomplexsystems.org" target="_blank">Complex Systems Center</a> at the University of Vermont as an Assistant Professor of Statistics.
    I consider myself a <b>computational social scientist</b> and a <b>data scientist</b>.

    I received my PhD from the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the area of <b>Science Policy</b>, advised by <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/" target="_blank">Aaron Clauset</a>. 

    <p>
    My research focuses on understanding causality in complex systems, with the goal of illuminating the mechanisms that drive inequalities in our social world. I apply techniques from mathematics and computer science toward the study of real-world social systems with complex heterogeneities and endogeneities, such as academic careers and human rights, aiming to produce scientific insights that can inform public policy.

<p>
My work has appeared in high-profile journals such as <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science Advances</em>, <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, and <em>Nature Communications</em>.
    I have been recognized as a <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/rising-stars-in-data-science-2/2023-rising-stars/" target="_blank">University of Chicago Rising Star in Data Science</a>.

    <p>
    During my PhD, I was a (2x) research intern with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/computational-social-science/" target="_blank">MSR NYC Computational Social Science group</a> and a <a href="https://hrdag.org/people/sam-zhang/" target="_blank">Data Science & Human Rights Fellow</a> with <a href="https://hrdag.org" target="_blank">HRDAG</a>.
    Previously, I worked as a software consultant at Pivotal Labs, a software engineer at multiple startups including on a DARPA project, and as a <a href="https://dssgfellowship.org/" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the University of Chicago. 
        I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Psychology from Swarthmore College in 2014.

    <p>
    During my PhD, I was a proud union member, organizing to improve public higher education in Colorado with <a href="https://ucwcolorado.org" target="_blank">United Campus Workers Colorado</a>. I served three terms as an officer on the Executive Board of <a href="https://cwa7799.org" target="_blank">CWA 7799</a>.
