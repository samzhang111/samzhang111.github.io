    I am a software engineer at <a href="https://opencounter.com">OpenCounter</a>, a Code for America alumnus company that makes software for local governments!

    <p>

    Formerly, I worked at <a href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a>, where I helped companies build better software by pair programming with their engineers.

    <p>

    Before that, I worked on rapid prototyping data science tools for <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-traffickers-caught-on-hidden-internet/">Memex</a>, a DARPA project
    based on domain-specific search and index.

    <p>

    I am an <a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu">Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a>. I talk about this briefly with "fellow fellow" Peter Landwehr on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/techshift/tech-shift-using-data-science-for-common-good">WBEZ TechShift</a>. I also shared air-time on <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/beyond-ad-clicks-using-big-data-social-good">NPR Marketplace</a> with Matt Conway's pie.
