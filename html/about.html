    <div class="intro">
        <p>
        I am a PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
        My advisor is <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/">Aaron Clauset</a>.
        Recently, I was a summer research intern with the Computational Social Science group at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/computational-social-science/">Microsoft Research NYC</a>.

        <p>
        My research is in computational social science and applied and interdisciplinary statistics more broadly.
        I also love making mathematical visualizations, many of which are on display below.

        <p>
        I was a 2014 <a href="https://dssgfellowship.org/">Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the University of Chicago (now at CMU), and a lead project scoper for the <a href="https://www.solveforgood.org">2020 Solve for Good Summer</a>. 
        Additionally, prior to my PhD, I worked as a professional software engineer at the consultancy formerly known as <a href="https://pivotal.io/labs">Pivotal Labs</a> and the Code for America startup <a href="https://opencounter.com/">OpenCounter</a>.
        I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Psychology from Swarthmore College in 2014.
<p>
I am proud to be organizing for the future of public higher education in Colorado with our wall-to-wall university labor union, <a href="https://ucwcolorado.org">United Campus Workers - CWA Local 7799</a>.
My other hobbies include taking <a href="/images/tulia2.jpg">my</a> <a href="/images/long.jpg">long</a> <a href="/images/boop.jpg">dog</a> on <a href="/images/hike.jpg">adventures</a>, and as of late, biking.
