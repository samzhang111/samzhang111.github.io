<h1>About me</h1>

<div content>

    Sam Zhang is a software engineer living in Boulder, Colorado. 

    <p>
    I enjoy reading technical books written for "enthusiastic beginners", especially around math. I also like well-written books about computer science and programming. Recommend me a book!

    <p>
    
    I'm open to contracting work or consulting work. You can look through my <a href="https://github.com/samzhang111">Github</a> and <a href="https://registry.jsonresume.org/szhang">resume</a>.

    <p>

    Formerly, I was a software engineer at <a href="https://opencounter.com">OpenCounter</a>, building cutting edge tools for city governments such as <a href="https://blog.opencounter.com/how-opencounter-designed-a-use-code-search-engine-for-local-governments-9e3f845516ee">this use code search engine</a>. I was also one of the first engineers at the DC office at <a href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a>, where I anchored several large projects to success, especially in the areas of data science tools, Python, and web scraping.

    <p>

    Before that, I rapid prototyped search and index tools to uncover human trafficking on the Internet for <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-traffickers-caught-on-hidden-internet/">Memex</a>, a DARPA project to advance the state of the art of web scrapers and search engines.

    <p>

    I worked with Enroll America to model uninsuredness and Obamacare outreach at the national level as an <a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu">Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a>. I talk about this briefly with "fellow fellow" Peter Landwehr on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/techshift/tech-shift-using-data-science-for-common-good">WBEZ TechShift</a>. I also shared air-time on <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/beyond-ad-clicks-using-big-data-social-good">NPR Marketplace</a> with Matt Conway's pie.
    <p>

    I went to a gloomy college in Swarthmore, PA where I studied under miraculously good professors and learned to love the library.
