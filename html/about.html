    I have been working on interesting problems and helping modernize city governments at <a href="https://opencounter.com">OpenCounter</a>, a Code for America alumnus company. Most recently, I built a search engine for city use codes based off word vectors.

    Formerly, I was one of the first engineers at the DC office at <a href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a>, where I anchored several large projects to success, especially in the areas of data science tools, Python, and web scraping.

    <p>

    Before that, I rapid prototyped search and index tools to uncover human trafficking on the Internet for <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-traffickers-caught-on-hidden-internet/">Memex</a>, a DARPA project to advance the state of the art of web scrapers and search engines.

    I worked with Enroll America to model uninsuredness and Obamacare outreach at the national level as an <a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu">Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a>. I talk about this briefly with "fellow fellow" Peter Landwehr on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/techshift/tech-shift-using-data-science-for-common-good">WBEZ TechShift</a>. I also shared air-time on <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/beyond-ad-clicks-using-big-data-social-good">NPR Marketplace</a> with Matt Conway's pie.
