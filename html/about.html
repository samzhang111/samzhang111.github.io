    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the University of Vermont, a core faculty member of the <a href="https://vermontcomplexsystems.org" target="_blank">Vermont Complex Systems Institute</a>, and a <a href="https://urssi.us/" target="_blank">US Research Software Sustainability Institute</a> Early-Career Fellow. I conduct research on the dynamics of science, inequality in academia, and the broader social impacts of data and networks. At the Vermont Complex Systems Institute, my collaborators and I develop and apply methods drawing on mathematics, network science, and data science. Our work examines how
institutions shape scientific careers, how biases and hierarchies propagate through systems, and how quantitative approaches can inform questions of human rights and policy, helping to reveal both structural drivers and actionable insights. Our research has appeared in journals such as <em>Nature</em>, <em>PNAS</em>, and <em>Science Advances</em>, and has been applied in contexts ranging from science policy to climate action.

Previously, I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://santafe.edu" target="_blank">Santa Fe Institute</a>, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.santafe.edu/~moore/" target="_blank">Cris Moore</a> on various quantitative studies of the criminal legal system.
    I received my PhD from the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the area of <b>Science Policy</b>, advised by <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/" target="_blank">Aaron Clauset</a> and <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/" target="_blank">Dan Larremore</a>.

    During my PhD, I was a (2x) research intern with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/computational-social-science/" target="_blank">MSR NYC Computational Social Science group</a> and a <a href="https://hrdag.org/people/sam-zhang/" target="_blank">Data Science & Human Rights Fellow</a> with <a href="https://hrdag.org" target="_blank">HRDAG</a>.
    I have been recognized as a <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/rising-stars-in-data-science-2/2023-rising-stars/" target="_blank">University of Chicago Rising Star in Data Science</a>.
    Previously, I worked as a software consultant at Pivotal Labs, a software engineer at multiple startups including on a DARPA project, and as a <a href="https://dssgfellowship.org/" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the University of Chicago. 
        I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Psychology from Swarthmore College in 2014.
