    <b>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder</b>, and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the area of <b>Science Policy</b>.
    I will be joining the Santa Fe Institute as a postdoc in October 2024, and starting as an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the University of Vermont in Fall 2025.
    I consider myself a <b>computational social scientist</b> and a <b>data scientist</b>. My advisor is <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/" target="_blank">Aaron Clauset</a>. 

    <p>
    My research focuses on understanding causality in complex systems, and in particular, illuminating the mechanisms that drive inequalities in our social world. I apply techniques from mathematics and computer science to untangle the feedback loops and heterogeneities in empirical datasets, with an aim of creating impactful research that can inform public policy.
    <p>
In particular, some current areas of study are scientific decision-making, academic careers, and global human rights. 

<p>
My work has appeared in high-profile journals such as <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science Advances</em>, <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, and <em>Nature Communications</em>.
    I have been recognized as a <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/rising-stars-in-data-science-2/2023-rising-stars/" target="_blank">University of Chicago Rising Star in Data Science</a>.

    <p>
    During my PhD, I was a (2x) research intern with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/computational-social-science/" target="_blank">MSR NYC Computational Social Science group</a> and a <a href="https://hrdag.org/people/sam-zhang/" target="_blank">Data Science & Human Rights Fellow</a> with <a href="https://hrdag.org" target="_blank">HRDAG</a>.
    Previously, I worked as a software consultant at Pivotal Labs, a software engineer at multiple startups including on a DARPA project, and as a <a href="https://dssgfellowship.org/" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the University of Chicago. 
        I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Psychology from Swarthmore College in 2014.

    <p>
    <b>I am organizing to improve public higher education with my labor union</b>, <a href="https://ucwcolorado.org" target="_blank">United Campus Workers Colorado</a>, and currently serving my third term on the Executive Board of <a href="https://cwa7799.org" target="_blank">CWA 7799</a>.
