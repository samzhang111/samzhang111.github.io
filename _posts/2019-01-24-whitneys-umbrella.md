I've been test driving the excellent [mathbox](https://github.com/unconed/mathbox/) WebGL library. For starters, here's a pan-and-zoomable [Whitney's umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_umbrella):

<div id="umbrella" style="width:600px;height:600px;margin-right:auto"></div>

[Full screen version](/html/fullscreen/umbrella). 

I have been thinking about how to organize the contents of this blog more visually as well. More posts with 3d visualizations to come.

My main inspirations for beautiful mathematical illustrations have been [Geometry and the Imagination](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-and-the-imagination) and [A Topological Picturebook](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387345420). As I become more comfortable with mathbox, and (painfully) shake the rust off of my d3 skills (while learning d3 v4), I hope more of the images from those books make their way to this blog.
