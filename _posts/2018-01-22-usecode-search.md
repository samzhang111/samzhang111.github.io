I published this blog post about a project I did with OpenCounter to make a search engine for municipal land use codes: [https://blog.opencounter.com/how-opencounter-designed-a-use-code-search-engine-for-local-governments-9e3f845516ee](https://blog.opencounter.com/how-opencounter-designed-a-use-code-search-engine-for-local-governments-9e3f845516ee).

Editing this post now in December 2018, what is interesting looking back is how hard I was attempting to overcome the Euclidean nature of these word embeddings. See [this blog post from Stanford](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/03/19/hyperbolics/) for a nice overview of some recent results that have been pouring out of the machine learning community, where they are discovering useful ways of using hyperbolic space to represent graphs and networks instead.
