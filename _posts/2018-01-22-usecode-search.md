I published this blog post about a project I did with OpenCounter to make a search engine for municipal land use codes: https://blog.opencounter.com/how-opencounter-designed-a-use-code-search-engine-for-local-governments-9e3f845516ee

The math Unicode symbols haven't been rendering consistently across browsers, so this is a PDF cache: https://sam.zhang.fyi/assets/usecode-search.pdf
